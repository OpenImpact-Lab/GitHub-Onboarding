This tutorial is designed for anyone who wants to learn how to use GitHub, regardless of their technical background.

## Setting Up Your GitHub Account

To get started with GitHub, you'll need to create an account. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and follow the instructions to sign up.

## Creating a Repository

A repository (repo) is a storage location for your project's files. To create a new repository, click the "+" button in the upper right corner of GitHub and select "New repository".

## Understanding Branches

[//]: # (Explain what branches are and why they are used.)
Branches are used to develop features or fix bugs in isolation from the main codebase. The main branch is typically called "main" or "master".

## Making Commits

A commit is a snapshot of your changes. To commit your changes, use the `git commit` command. Write clear and concise commit messages to explain your changes.

## Pull Requests and Code Review

A pull request (PR) is a request to merge your changes into the main codebase. Code review is the process of reviewing code changes before they are merged.
