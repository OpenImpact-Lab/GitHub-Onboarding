2.  **Create a branch:** Create a new branch for your contributions using `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
3.  **Make changes:** Experiment with adding, modifying, or deleting files. Make sure to follow any guidelines provided in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
4.  **Commit your changes:** Stage your changes with `git add .` (or `git add <specific file>`) and commit them with a descriptive message using `git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"`.
5.  **Push your branch:** Push your branch to the remote repository using `git push origin your-branch-name`.
6.  **Create a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request to merge your branch into the `main` branch.

## Contributing

## Onboarding Tasks

To get started with Git and GitHub, please complete the following tasks:

1.  Create a new branch named `your-name-branch`.
2.  Add a file named `your-name.txt` to the `contributors` directory with a brief introduction about yourself.
3.  Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
4.  Push your branch to the remote repository.
5.  Create a pull request to merge your branch into the `main` branch.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I'm having trouble cloning the repository.**
A: Make sure you have Git installed correctly and that you have the correct SSH keys configured (if using SSH). See [GitHub's documentation on cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for more information.

**Q: How do I resolve a merge conflict?**
A: Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches. See the [MERGE_CONFLICTS.md](MERGE_CONFLICTS.md) file for detailed instructions.
